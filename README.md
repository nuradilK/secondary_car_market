Kolesa cars analysis
This ipython notebook shows some brief analysis of the secondary car market in Kazakhstan. The data I am using in the analysis was scraped through BeautifulSoup from Kolesa.kz. There are about 100k cars info with great amount of parameters. To be honest, theere are also some room for further analysis. I will add some more analysis. 

# To do
In the near future, I am going to make a model to predict car prices.
